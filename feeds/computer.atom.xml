&lt;p&gt;I have spent however far too much time adjusting the way this site looks, and I am never satisfied. I have a designer&amp;#8217;s eye but a designer&amp;#8217;s skill definitely&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have googled the net and finally I have landed on something, a &amp;#8220;responsive&amp;#8221;  (whatever that means in nerdish) theme, that even with my limited web skills, was actually easy to install on my jekyll&amp;nbsp;blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme is called &lt;a href="http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/"&gt;So Simple&lt;/a&gt; and I like it because is clean and refined. I like it so much that I haven&amp;#8217;t changed anything &amp;#8212; and I would like to keep it that way. I mean, let&amp;#8217;s focus on the&amp;nbsp;content!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you go. This is the new&amp;nbsp;look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#8217;s what this site looked&amp;nbsp;before:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/old-blog-design-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I guess there are countless apps to do this but all I needed is something basic that I can access from anywhere. Since I already have synced my iPhone with Google Calendar, I can basically enter data from wherever I am, even if there is no internet connection, and then have it synced back to my main repository on Google servers as soon as I&amp;#8217;m back&amp;nbsp;online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what I did is a little Python script that gathers all this data and spits out a few statistics and&amp;nbsp;graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First however I need to explain what are my conventions to enter my activities in Google Calendar. I have four main categories: running, biking, swimming and &amp;#8220;other&amp;#8221; (which includes things I used to do but don&amp;#8217;t do anymore or other occasional outdoor&amp;nbsp;activities).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically I enter in my calendar an event that begins with &amp;#8220;B&amp;#8221; for biking, &amp;#8220;S&amp;#8221; for swimming, &amp;#8220;R&amp;#8221; for running. All the other activities that I enter are classified in the &amp;#8220;other&amp;#8221; category. Now I use a separate calendar to enter all of these items (aptly named &amp;#8220;Sport&amp;#8221;) &amp;#8212; and I suggest you do the same if you also use Google Calendar for other purposes. In the script below however I have set the calendar name to the default, so you may want to change that name using the calendar &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:nota-calendar-id"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota-calendar-id"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are two examples of the yearly&amp;nbsp;reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/179731/sport_gcal_2010.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/179731/sport_gcal_2012.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is what a typical month looks like in my Google Calendar (there is some differences in the codes that I use because for example I enter &amp;#8220;C&amp;#8221; for &lt;em&gt;corsa&lt;/em&gt;, which is the italian for running; likewise I have two separate categories for biking, &amp;#8220;B&amp;#8221; for road biking and &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MTB&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; for mountain biking; in the script however I have simplified the categories and only included one). You can also notice how I write additional info like duration and length whenever possible; someday I&amp;#8217;ll get around to do a Python script also to collect and make stats on this&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/179731/google_calendar_esempio.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, here&amp;#8217;s the script (please read the notes&amp;nbsp;below):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::python

    show(block=False)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;def DateRangeQuery(calendar_service, start_date, end_date, calname):
    aaa=[]
    query = gdata.calendar.service.CalendarEventQuery(calname, &amp;#8216;private&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;full&amp;#8217;)

    out=main()&amp;nbsp;show()&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few notes about this&amp;nbsp;script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is tested on Mac &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; X using the latest &lt;a href="https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/"&gt;Canopy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;installation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to have the &lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/"&gt;gdata Python library&lt;/a&gt; installed. There is a way to avoid importing the library altogether&lt;sup id="fnref:nota-install-gdata"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota-install-gdata"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. What you need to do is just to make the &lt;code&gt;gdata&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;atom&lt;/code&gt; subdirectories that you find below &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; after unpacking the tar.gz available in the directory where you run the script. By the way, I have used &lt;code&gt;gdata-2.0.18.tar.gz&lt;/code&gt; which is the latest version at the time of&amp;nbsp;writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another way to avoid installing gdata but keeping things a bit more organized is to keep the gdata folder stored somewhere and then add its path by inserting these two lines at the&amp;nbsp;beginning:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::python
import sys
sys.path.append(&amp;#8220;~/Documents/_PROG/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PYTHON&lt;/span&gt;/gdata-2.0.18/src/gdata&amp;#8221;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For some reasons however the above method only works if I run the script from within Canopy and not from Terminal. I have no idea why and I have no intention to spend any more time investigating this little&amp;nbsp;bugger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This script works from the terminal by typing &lt;code&gt;$ python gcal_sport.py&lt;/code&gt; or whatever you want to call this script. To make the plots persistent I had to add the &lt;code&gt;show(block=False)&lt;/code&gt; in the main function and &lt;code&gt;show()&lt;/code&gt; at the end of the script. If you run it under iPython (Canopy for example uses iPython) then you can get rid of the &lt;code&gt;block=False&lt;/code&gt; option and delete the last &lt;code&gt;show()&lt;/code&gt; line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not a huge nerd but I can make this stuff work. I wanted to share this script because I find it useful and maybe some other poor devil will find some use for it. The point is that I have no intention nor time to help Windows users, or people that don&amp;#8217;t even know what Python is. For all of you sane people please go see my &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/tags.html#weekly%20snaps-ref"&gt;photographs&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:nota-calendar-id"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you have to get the calendar &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;. If you go into your calendar and click on the down arrow icon next to the name you will see an option for Calendar Settings. Select that menu item. Near the bottom you will see Calendar Address. It will take a moment to find the Calendar &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; and it will look something like &lt;code&gt;o4g3921hdiaq5p8kdat2l4vgis@group.calendar.google.com&lt;/code&gt;. (from &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/555468/how-do-i-insert-into-non-default-google-calendar-using-zend-php"&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/555468/how-do-i-insert-into-non-default-google-calendar-using-zend-php&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota-calendar-id" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:nota-install-gdata"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to find this workaround because in Canopy Express (the free distribution) you can not install through the package manager some less used libraries such as gdata.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota-install-gdata" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently David Pogue &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/06/technology/personaltech/too-many-passwords-and-no-way-to-remember-them-until-now.html"&gt;published an enthusiastic review of Dashlane&lt;/a&gt;; I tried it, got quickly pissed off because of the way it&amp;#8217;s priced (sync between devices for a $30 annual fee? Are they nuts?), so what this review has done for me was only to renew my interest in finding a free, open-source alternative to keep my&amp;nbsp;passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should say that my life has changed &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-08-04-valentina.html"&gt;dramatically&lt;/a&gt; since 2011 but what is unchanged is my attitude towards these things, which means (1) I&amp;#8217;m definitely not a paranoid geek and (2) I have actually reduced my online presence so the number of passwords and sites that I visit have not&amp;nbsp;increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I need is a simple solution to have readily available (i.e., on my iPhone) my sensitive information protected by a password, and maybe have it in sync with a desktop&amp;nbsp;app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like KeePass remains the only free and robust solution, stil ugly as hell on a Mac. But what I have found is a native &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; X version which is still in alpha but works pretty well (&lt;a href="http://www.keepassx.org"&gt;KeePassX&lt;/a&gt;) and a free iOS version (&lt;a href="http://minikeepass.github.io"&gt;MiniKeePass&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what I did was start from scratch (i.e., a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt; file with all my passwords, easy to create and update with Excel or Numbers; in my case it was output by &lt;a href="http://www.venticentostudio.it/site/iBackup.htm"&gt;iBackup&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8212; the little companion app distributed for free by the creators of &lt;a href="http://www.venticentostudio.it/site/iAccounts.htm"&gt;iAccounts&lt;/a&gt;, for my wife&amp;#8217;s passwords I created the table from scratch as it was easy to manage her five or so accounts). I had to go through the ugly &lt;a href="http://keepass.info"&gt;KeePass&lt;/a&gt; running with &lt;a href="http://keepass.info/help/v2/setup.html#mono"&gt;Mono&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; X (if it was just ugly then  it would not have been such a nightmare, but it&amp;#8217;s also slow and prone to crashing) just because it&amp;#8217;s the only application that allowed to import csv files (KeePassX does not). I then saved it to a KeePass 2.x database file (&lt;code&gt;.kdbx&lt;/code&gt;) which you can open in KeePassX and&amp;nbsp;MiniKeePass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the syncing? Well there&amp;#8217;s no &amp;#8216;real&amp;#8217; sync but if you store the &lt;code&gt;.kdbx&lt;/code&gt; file in your dropbox then you have the possibility to load it directly from MiniKeePass on your iPhone&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, use it as you wish, then if you make some modifications you can save it back to your drobox and then you can open it from your mac with KeePassX. Since a password database is not like a notebook that you frequently make changes across devices then I don&amp;#8217;t see this as a major&amp;nbsp;inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s important is that MiniKeePass is a simple but efficient application, offering you an extra layer of security given by the possibility of a numeric keycode to activate the app; it also gives you the possibility to access multiple .kdbx databases so that&amp;#8217;s interesting too. A nice touch is that if you tap on a field it automatically copies the content in the clipboard, ready to be pasted back in some website. The KeePass database then is sufficiently freeform that you can store pretty much any information you want (there is no restriction on the fields like password, user id, etc., nor on the content of these fields i.e. you don&amp;#8217;t have to choose in advance if a field is only&amp;nbsp;numeric).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#8217;s my open-source solution to store my passwords and keep them &amp;#8216;synced&amp;#8217; between my iPhone and my main computer. Hope somebody else finds this&amp;nbsp;useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;well not really &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; because youhave to open it with the Dropbox app and then choose the option to &amp;#8220;open the file&amp;#8221; with MiniKeePass.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 3rd generation iPad was in fact a little disappointing in terms of performances compared to the non-retina iPad 2; to move all those pixels you need a beefier cpu and not just the slightly tuned A5. Now, with the 4th generation iPad and its &lt;span class="caps"&gt;A6X&lt;/span&gt; cpu, there&amp;#8217;s (apparently) some serious power to move four million pixels around. If Apple had put a retina display on the iPad mini we probably wouldn&amp;#8217;t have had enough battery life (assuming the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;A6X&lt;/span&gt; was used) or the display refresh would have been too unbearably slow (keeping the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;A5X&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it&amp;#8217;s obvious that one year from now there &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be a retina iPad mini; in some secret laboratory around Cupertino  (or maybe on Tim Cook&amp;#8217;s desk) propotypes of this little demon are already running 24/7. But we know that one year is the life cycle of these devices so I want to concentrate on this year&amp;#8217;s iPad&amp;nbsp;mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second disappointment is the price: I was expecting to pay $250 for the base model, and I was willing to concede Apple the extra $50 compared to Google&amp;#8217;s Nexus because of the more rounded experience that iPad currently offers. But $329 for the 16Gb model is too close to the price of the larger iPad 2. Will it stop me from buying it? No, because I wanted a smaller, more portable device; something integrated with my iPhone and my computer at home running &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; X; something that I already know how to use and does not give me headaches&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; . But if I want to give a tablet to my mum for example, so that she can check my newborn daughter&amp;#8217;s progress, I will not spend $329 and I will seriously look at some Android alternative&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the point is &amp;#8212; what do you need a tablet for? I have already detailed my ideal needs &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-07-19-ipad-mini-needs.html"&gt;in the aforementioned post&lt;/a&gt;, but to recap and recalibrate my ideas: I would need it (omitting the obvious internet/email things) to store and do a first quick review of photographs, when I&amp;#8217;m away from home for some extended period of time; to work on my writing (I use very often Byword on my iPhone and I&amp;#8217;m sure that doing so on a larger display would help immensely); for sketching and reading and annotating PDFs (I have always been unable to read PDFs on a computer screen, but doing that on an iPad is slightly more convenient)&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes I know, all boring and conventional stuff, something that I am pretty certain that an iPad mini will allow me to do easily. &lt;br&gt;
But what about something new, something that could really alter a photographer&amp;#8217;s workflow, and maybe improve it? Back in 2010 I had &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2010-08-03-ipad-and-photography.html"&gt;an idea about using a tablet to help a photographer&amp;#8217;s work&lt;/a&gt;. Later on, I found that my ideas/dreams were realized by some &lt;a href="http://www.photosmithapp.com/"&gt;clever&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://pixelsyncapp.com/"&gt;folks&lt;/a&gt;, but very little is made of these apps when discussing iPads/tablets and photography, and the usual story is about using the tablet as a portfolio&amp;nbsp;viewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I ask myself, is there something else I could use an iPad for? how do skilled photographers (not tech-nerds, because I don&amp;#8217;t want to end up reading the equivalent of using iPhones for shopping lists) use their tablets&amp;nbsp;for? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, there&amp;#8217;s this Google &amp;#8220;Guy&amp;#8221;&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  that &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/111962077049890418486/posts/CJuo23L5Nb7"&gt;likes his Nexus 7&lt;/a&gt;. Another article called &lt;a href="http://connect.dpreview.com/post/2693143833/ipad-3rd-generation-workflow"&gt;&amp;#8220;The iPad Workflow&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; was recently published on Dpreview Connect; there are some good points but nothing too outrageously&amp;nbsp;inventive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But apart from that, is there some more interesting stories about for example a real editing workflow example for photographers? I guess I will end up using the iPad to watch some movies after all, and photography will be still made with a camera and a normal&amp;nbsp;computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t care too much about the iMacs (even though they look amazing) &amp;#8212; I prefer to have my display separated from my machine. The Macmini is still my favourite Apple desktop computer; I have been a happy Macmini user for a long time, the first one was the original powered by the PowerPC G4, then a Core 2 Duo 2.66ghz which I still have it running as my media player running &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XBMC&lt;/span&gt;. The problem with the current Macmini is that the quad-core version is a bit too expensive. What I care about is the Macbook pro 13&amp;#8221; with retina display, really appealing for my current heavy Aperture use. For the moment however I&amp;#8217;ll hold on to my old Macbook Air 11&amp;#8221; and my Hackintosh which is so more powerful with its 3.33Ghz quad-core i5, SSDs; it&amp;#8217;s becoming however more likely that in the future I&amp;#8217;ll go back to a single computer, maybe the 15&amp;#8221; Pro connected to the same Eizo 24&amp;#8221; monitor for some comfortable photo editing sessions at home, and possibly the iPad mini as my to-go machine.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day I played with my friend&amp;#8217;s Galaxy Note 2; a 5&amp;#8221; hybrid smarthone-tablet , great display and fast and powerful and full of interesting details and though-out applications; it even has a stylus, which looks dorky but for some precision work beats the fat fingers hands down. The problem is that such a device tries too hard to do more things than an iPad, and in doing so it becomes too convoluted; and if a user like me, who scores high on the nerd-scale, finds it &amp;#8220;complicated&amp;#8221; , I can only imagine the frustration that a normal user (mum; grandpa; your older brother who does not really click with technology; etc.) could experience.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only viable options at the time of writing are one of the Samsung Galaxy-whatever and Google&amp;#8217;s Nexus 7; right now I am waiting for the delivery of a chinese knock-off which I bought for a ridicolously low price &amp;#8212; if the experiment goes well, I will write something more about it.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the 32gb wifi version is the one that I will probably go for. And next year I will surely sweat over the &amp;#8220;iPad mini with Retina display&amp;#8221;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unwanted pun; I just realized that the guy&amp;#8217;s name is Romain &lt;em&gt;Guy&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, bear with me for just a few moments, because all I want to do is tell you why I&amp;#8217;d like an iPad&amp;nbsp;Mini:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to read pdfs; using every now and then my wife&amp;#8217;s iPad I realize that it is the best way to read magazines and study/annotate scientific articles. A smaller iPad would be just fine for me because otherwise I would end up just leaving it at&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to collect my photos in a portfolio (which means at least 32 Gb for&amp;nbsp;me).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to mess around with snapshots (I won&amp;#8217;t say &amp;#8220;edit&amp;#8221; because I feel that real editing can only be done with a bigger computer); I have had recently so much fun playing with &lt;a href="http://www.snapseed.com/"&gt;Snapseed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://dipticapp.com/"&gt;Diptic&lt;/a&gt; on my iPhone that I think using them on a larger display would only make things even more fun. What I&amp;#8217;m thinking is iPhone shots, not Nikon D7000 shots, instantaneously zapped to the iPad Mini via&amp;nbsp;iCloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aperture/Lightroom library editing on the go; there are these apps (&lt;a href="http://www.pixelsyncapp.com/"&gt;Pixelsync&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.photosmithapp.com/"&gt;Photosmith&lt;/a&gt;) that allow you to do what I think is the most tiresome yet essential activity in photo editing &amp;#8212; pruning the bad apples, deciding what&amp;#8217;s a keeper. I would like to use one of these apps while I&amp;#8217;m watching The Wire on the&amp;nbsp;couch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#8217;s all I want to do on an iPad&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. And if I could do these things on a much cheaper device (€200-250) then I would seriously consider buying&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that could be a deal-breaker: non-retina screen. After having used the iPhone 4S retina screen I would have troubles adjusting to a lesser quality screen, especially considering that 60% of what I&amp;#8217;d do is&amp;nbsp;reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have obviously left aside the usual activities where the iPad shines (reading news, surfing the net, emailing) because these things alone have not been so powerful to force me considering the purchase of an iPad.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;what&amp;nbsp;next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launch gmapbuilder, select the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TDB&lt;/span&gt; file &lt;code&gt;mapsetc.tdb&lt;/code&gt;, then the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TYP&lt;/span&gt; file and then click &lt;code&gt;convert&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TDB&lt;/span&gt; file can&amp;nbsp;be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mapsetc: map + contourlines&amp;nbsp;(default)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mapsetx: map&amp;nbsp;only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mapsetz: contourlines&amp;nbsp;only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TYP&lt;/span&gt; files specify the graphical format of the&amp;nbsp;map:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy: simple layout with no extra&amp;nbsp;information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hike: &amp;#8216;hiking&amp;#8217;&amp;nbsp;map(?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thin: optimzed for Gpsmap60/76 and&amp;nbsp;Dakota&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wide: high contrast style optimzed for Oregon and&amp;nbsp;Colorado&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clas: &amp;#8216;classic&amp;#8217; version, optimized for Vista, Legend, Edge&amp;nbsp;705&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trad: &amp;#8216;traditional&amp;#8217;(?), my preferred&amp;nbsp;choice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/179731/openmtbmaps-00.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/179731/openmtbmaps-01.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/179731/openmtbmaps-05.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the result of creating the map with contour lines embedded (i.e. using &lt;code&gt;mapsetc.tdb&lt;/code&gt;; I highly recommend using this style as contour lines may be switched off in Basecamp and they don&amp;#8217;t add too much data to the final&amp;nbsp;map):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/179731/openmtbmaps-06.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, here I have selected &lt;code&gt;mapsetc&lt;/code&gt; to have both vector maps and contour lines available; the style file is &lt;code&gt;trad&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simpler procedure exists if you&amp;#8217;re looking for the basic OpenStreetMaps (which are more clear and easier to use for road and city navigation, expect very little detail off the beaten path though). Just go to &lt;a href="http://garmin.openstreetmap.nl/"&gt;garmin.openstreetmap.nl&lt;/a&gt; and you can build your own customized map in &lt;code&gt;.gmapi&lt;/code&gt; format. An email with a link to 3 versions of the selected maps (Windows, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; X and Garmin gps formats) will be in your inbox usually after a few&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok let me say that there&amp;#8217;s a happy ending to this story: the motherboards were not dead but only in a coma.

&lt;h2&gt;details of a hackintosh entering  a&amp;nbsp;coma&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I built &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-05-03-my-new-mac-is-a-hack.html"&gt;these two hackintosh&lt;/a&gt;, one for me (A) one for a friend&amp;nbsp;(B). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;component | hackintosh (A)                | hackintosh (B)             &lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt;       | Intel Core i5-2500K 3.3GHz    | Intel Core i3-2105 3.1Hz &lt;br&gt;
M/board   | Gigabyte &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GA&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;H61N&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB3&lt;/span&gt;         | Gigabyte &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GA&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;H61N&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB3&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;br&gt;
ram       | Corsair 2x4Gb &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XMS&lt;/span&gt;             | Corsair 2x4Gb Value          &lt;br&gt;
hd        | Corsair &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;115GB&lt;/span&gt;             | Corsair ssd &lt;span class="caps"&gt;115GB&lt;/span&gt;
case      | Silverstone &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SST&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SG05B&lt;/span&gt;         | Nilox / Apex &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MI&lt;/span&gt;-10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, fairly standard builds following the &lt;a href="http://tonymacx86.blogspot.it/2011/09/building-sandy-bridge-customac-customac.html"&gt;hackmini example by tonymac&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I updated the bios to F7 (h16nusb3.f7 from Gigabyte website), installed Lion 10.7.3 through Unibeast Lion&amp;nbsp;10.7.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hackintosh A was the first one to die (alas, to enter a coma); it worked great for an entire week then one day I switched it on, could hear the fans whirring away, the hard drive starting up, but no output on the screen, so I couldn&amp;#8217;t even get to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIOS&lt;/span&gt; screen and do something. I had the cpu replaced from amazon.it because I thought that was the only thing that could have failed, but when I tried the new one nothing&amp;nbsp;changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I went to Filippo&amp;#8217;s house (owner of hackintosh B), replaced my motherboard with his, and blam, the hack is alive! So I&amp;#8217;m happy because I know that it&amp;#8217;s the motherboard that doesn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the next day Filippo calls, the same thing happened to his computer! Stuck on a black screen, the system doesn&amp;#8217;t even load the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIOS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two motherboards, same model, different CPUs but really this should not matter, different cases. No idea about how this could happen. A defective batch of these two motherboards even if they are very common (and recommended to build hackintosh)? My case (a rather expensive Silverstone &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SG05&lt;/span&gt;) burning something on the&amp;nbsp;board?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sent my motherboard to the online shop&amp;#8217;s customer service (in the meantime, a month goes by) and rather unexpectedly they said that nothing was broken, that my m/b was running ok, only thing they did was to upgrade the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIOS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait a second, how did you do that if there&amp;#8217;s no display output whatsoever? &amp;#8220;Oh well we used an external graphic card&amp;#8221;. So that&amp;#8217;s it? I was still a bit skeptical but then I decided to buy an external graphic card; I knew from internet discussions that this should speed up video and photo editing so that was an upgrade that I was willing to do. I went to a local shop this time and bought a whatever-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATI&lt;/span&gt;-5450 with 2Gb of ram for 45 euros (surely faster than the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt; that Apple puts inside the 2-grand macbook pro I reasoned). And guess what, the customer service guys were right; I could update the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIOS&lt;/span&gt; on Filippo&amp;#8217;s motherboard and that was&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes I had to play a little bit more to have the graphical card working ok on my hackintosh but now it seems like everything&amp;#8217;s running smoothly. I am still afraid to close the case (it&amp;#8217;s still a post-industrial sight my desktop, with all components running and clicking away in the open), but maybe now it&amp;#8217;s so hot here in Milano that I&amp;#8217;ll leave the machine like&amp;nbsp;this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just hope Giulia doesn&amp;#8217;t notice it because you know women want to have clean stuff around, especially if this half-assed mechanical monster happens to live in the baby room (another month and a half to go before my yet un-named babygirl comes into the&amp;nbsp;world).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;sidenotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I installed in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCI&lt;/span&gt;-E slot the graphic card I couldn&amp;#8217;t get any display once &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; X was loaded, so I had to use this switch at&amp;nbsp;boot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;GraphicsEnabler=No
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then I installed ATI5000Injector.kext using Kext Wizard. I did other bits too that I&amp;#8217;ve read &lt;a href="http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=260567"&gt;somewhere&lt;/a&gt;  but am not sure about them. Anyway, just in case I need them again: first, find the PCIRootUID of graphic card, by typing in from a terminal&amp;nbsp;window:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ioreg -l | grep -15 &amp;quot;AppleACPIPCI&amp;quot; | grep &amp;quot;_UID&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What this command does is giving you this &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UID&lt;/span&gt; number which you have to put into &lt;code&gt;/Extra/org.chameleon.Boot.plist&lt;/code&gt; by adding the following&amp;nbsp;lines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;PCIRootUID&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally I also added these other two lines (to have the card identified as a 5400 series instead of a&amp;nbsp;5000):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;AtiConfig&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Eulemur&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;a magical &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CI&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to find information to make the graphic card work I stumbled once more on some acronyms that these nerds in the forums use a lot. Let me write those down so I will remember&amp;nbsp;them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; = Quartz Extreme (&lt;a href="http://www.apple.com.../quartzextreme/"&gt;http://www.apple.com&amp;#8230;/quartzextreme/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CI&lt;/span&gt; = Core Image (&lt;a href="http://www.apple.com...ures/coreimage/"&gt;http://www.apple.com&amp;#8230;ures/coreimage/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;Q2DE&lt;/span&gt; = Quartz 2D&amp;nbsp;extreme &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other acronyms that are probably worth remembering can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=2789"&gt;http://www.tonymacx86.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=2789&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are things that make the graphical magic happens in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; X; sometimes a card will work but with no magic (i.e., no rippling water effects, no transparencies, etc.); and how do you know if the magic is not&amp;nbsp;there?:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Finder menu-bar is transparent, if a water ripple effect appears when you add a desktop widget and if you can zoom in/out on the desktop by holding ctrl while moving the mouse wheel then you have &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CI&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;update to lion&amp;nbsp;10.7.4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since everything was working I wanted some more troubles so I updated my system to 10.7.4 using the &lt;a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1524"&gt;Combo package&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, not unexpectedly, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; X crashed on restarting and had to boot from the unibeast &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; disk, selecting to boot from the drive with the newly installed system using these&amp;nbsp;switches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-v GeneratPStates=No DropSSDT=Yes
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I then ran Multibeast 4.5.2 using the &lt;a href="http://tonymacx86.blogspot.it/2012/05/dsdt-database-update-gigabyte-h67.html"&gt;updated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSDT&lt;/span&gt; for my motherboard&lt;/a&gt; and selected these&amp;nbsp;options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/179731/hackintosh%20multibeast%20update%201.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all worked out in the end except for the graphic card which was not recognized as a 5400; I edited again the &lt;code&gt;/Extra/org.chameleon.Boot.plist&lt;/code&gt; and added the AtiConfig/Eulemur strings (see above) so I reckon the correct way to install this card is just to use the &lt;code&gt;ATI5000Injector.kext&lt;/code&gt; and these two lines in the &lt;code&gt;chameleon.Boot.plist&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;final&amp;nbsp;results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is the updated list of components and total price for my&amp;nbsp;hackintosh:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;component | details                       | price [€]   | notes&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt;       | Intel Core i5-2500K 3.3GHz    | 185.25      | amazon.it&lt;br&gt;
M/board   | Gigabyte &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GA&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;H61N&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB3&lt;/span&gt;         | 78.36       | stele.it&lt;br&gt;

wifi      | &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TP&lt;/span&gt;-Link &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TL&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WN727N&lt;/span&gt;         | 7.66        | stele.it&lt;br&gt;

total     |                               | 575.85&amp;nbsp;|&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is the new benchmark comparison against other macs (small improvement in 10.7.4 using dedicated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSDT&lt;/span&gt; for the F8 Gigabyte m/b &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIOS&lt;/span&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xbench ran with no thread test otherwise it would lock up, and geekbench is the 32-bit tryout&amp;nbsp;mode.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="computer"></category><category term="tech"></category></entry><entry><title>my new mac is a hack</title><link href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-05-03-my-new-mac-is-a-hack.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-05-03T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2012-05-03T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Alessandro Amato del Monte</name></author><id>tag:aadm.github.io,2012-05-03:/2012-05-03-my-new-mac-is-a-hack.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/179731/IMG_4551_hackintosh.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I have waited a long time for a new macmini to replace my old one&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Apple did have something for me in the store, which was the 2011 server version with Intel Core i7, but it was definitely too expensive (€1000 with 4Gb of ram and not even an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSD&lt;/span&gt; or a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt;?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why I wanted a faster computer? Mainly because of Aperture &amp;#8212; too damned slow (and the Nikon D7000&amp;#8217;s 16Mp files didn&amp;#8217;t help either). Having a snappier machine to do some iMovie editing was an added bonus, but apart from that I must say that everyday tasks&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; are still handled perfectly by my even slower Macbook Air 1.4ghz &amp;#8212; a proof that a computer &amp;#8216;feels&amp;#8217; fast not because of the cpu but because you replaced that clunky old drive with an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSD&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day I discovered the infecting enthusiasm of Thomas Pindelski who wrote &lt;a href="http://pindelski.org/Photography/category/photography/hardware/hackintosh/"&gt;long and passionate pieces about his hackintosh&lt;/a&gt; and after about five minutes of internal debate I was already sold on the&amp;nbsp;idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prepared myself reading a few things on lifehacker and the reference site for all things hackintosh-related &lt;a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com"&gt;tonymacx86.com&lt;/a&gt;; I will give some pointers to the best resources at the end of this&amp;nbsp;article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the indications given in a &lt;a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/viewtopic.php?f=168&amp;amp;t=33412&amp;amp;p=209913#p209913"&gt;tonymacx86 forum thread&lt;/a&gt; I then ordered (on &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.it"&gt;amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="www.stele.it"&gt;stele.it&lt;/a&gt;) these&amp;nbsp;components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;7.66&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;bluetooth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Belkin Bluetooth &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; adapter&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8.54&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;amazon.it&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total cost is around €531; as you can see I did not go cheap on the case, shelling out a substantial percentage of my budget for a Silverstone &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SG05B&lt;/span&gt;. But the truth is that nothing beats Apple in terms of hardware; so my computer is indeed small and silent &amp;#8212; but only if we&amp;#8217;re talking PCs! Compared to any macmini this is just an ugly machine, not really silent (but still it&amp;#8217;s way better than the loud behemoths that I have at&amp;nbsp;work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cpu is a middle range quad-core cpu easily overclockable; I&amp;#8217;ve also chosen the more expensive memory sticks because they&amp;#8217;re supposed to be more reliable when overclocking. I kept a low profile here because I wasn&amp;#8217;t sure how smooth everything would go, but there is ample space for upgrades. For example the Intel Core i7 is supposed to smoke the i5 for video (and photo?) editing because of &lt;em&gt;hyperthreading&lt;/em&gt; which I don&amp;#8217;t really know what it is but apparently makes a quad-core cpu behave like an eight-core! Sounds fucking awesome, sure women will be&amp;nbsp;impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I&amp;#8217;m running the stupid &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HD3000&lt;/span&gt; gpu which is integrated into these Intel Core cpus and at the moment this is working great; I have to say, I have always thought that graphic cards are for gaming nerds but apparently also real applications like Aperture use the gpu to do some serious weight-lifting. So there you go, for now this machine is approximately four times faster than my old macmini and I&amp;#8217;m already in heaven. But if I ever feel this ugly box going slower than the speed of light then I will first add an external gpu, then swap the i5 with the&amp;nbsp;i7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the wifi &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; stick: basically you can buy whatever brand you want, but you need to be aware of the chipset inside to find the correct drivers and make it work. For example this &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TP&lt;/span&gt;-Link &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TL&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WN727N&lt;/span&gt; that I bought can either have a Ralink  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RT3070&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RT5370&lt;/span&gt; depending on the version (v1: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RT3070&lt;/span&gt;, v3: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RT5370&lt;/span&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;building the ugly&amp;nbsp;box&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fun and easy; the Gigabyte manual is very detailed and there&amp;#8217;s lots of figures and schematics so you just need to pay attention to the pin layout for the various&amp;nbsp;connectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not use any thermal paste between the stock Intel fan and the cpu; I hope it&amp;#8217;s true there&amp;#8217;s some already there (and in reality the little manual that comes with the cpu does not mention the thermal paste). For now, at normal clock speed, the temperature is perfectly under control and there&amp;#8217;s no sign of overheating. Some say that you need to replace the stock fan but really, I think Intel engineers know better than us. It&amp;#8217;s like when you change the exhaust on your Ducati and then realize that all it does is to make it louder and you lose horsepower and smoothness. Or you fit some Maxxis tires on your mountain bike where it&amp;#8217;s clearly labeled that you need a minimum pressure of two bars and then you put some 1.5 bars because guys on the internet forums say that this makes their tires &amp;#8216;sticky&amp;#8217;. Really, do you think you know better than the engineers that have designed these&amp;nbsp;things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is, well, black, big and ugly, but there&amp;#8217;s lots of space inside, so it didn&amp;#8217;t feel cramped when putting all things together. All the empty space also helps to keep the temperatures&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/179731/IMG_4510_hackintosh.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t need no optical disc so I used the only two hard drive connectors to plug in the cheap Corsair &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSD&lt;/span&gt; and a 2Tb &amp;#8216;green&amp;#8217; (5400 rpm, very quiet) hard disk that I previously had in an external &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said before, I used two &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; sticks for wifi and bluetooth. I could have used an internal wifi card but I wanted to keep the only &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCI&lt;/span&gt; slot on the motherboard available for a possible upgrade (a graphic card). And this little fucker was the only thing that gave me troubles; more on that later in the software&amp;nbsp;installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;installing the&amp;nbsp;system&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a piece of cake. Until I had to make wifi working, I&amp;nbsp;mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just followed &lt;a href="http://tonymacx86.blogspot.it/2011/10/unibeast-install-mac-os-x-lion-using.html"&gt;the instructions on tonymacx86&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;m not sure this is required anymore but I did all the main installation with only one drive attached (the main &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSD&lt;/span&gt;) and 4Gb of ram. After the installation I&amp;#8217;ve connected the other drive and put the extra ram&amp;nbsp;stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Belkin bluetooth thingy worked out of the box, no problems at all. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TP&lt;/span&gt;-link wifi stick on the other hand required some extra work; first an editing of the kext file then I added an extra piece of software to have an airport-like icon. I still don&amp;#8217;t know why I have such a lousy signal strength and how I can change to the &amp;#8216;other&amp;#8217; channel which has a 100% strength. But the network speed (tested with &lt;a href="http://speedtest.net"&gt;http://speedtest.net&lt;/a&gt;) is exactly the same as before so I guess it&amp;#8217;s a&amp;nbsp;non-issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I restored my old system from a Time Machine backup and there I was, with a hackintosh smoothly&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; running Mac &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; X&amp;nbsp;Lion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the main steps that I&amp;#8217;ve followed and noted down for my own&amp;nbsp;reference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;update &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIOS&lt;/span&gt; to F7 (h61nusb3.f7 from Gigabyte&amp;nbsp;website)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load Optimized Defaults and&amp;nbsp;reboot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIOS&lt;/span&gt; setting: On-Chip Frame Buffer Size &lt;span class="caps"&gt;480MB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;2MB&lt;/span&gt; (for 8Gb&amp;nbsp;system)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIOS&lt;/span&gt; setting: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HPET&lt;/span&gt; 64 bit&amp;nbsp;mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIOS&lt;/span&gt; setting: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SATA&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AHCI&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIOS&lt;/span&gt; setting: change hd/usb boot&amp;nbsp;sequence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unibeast to prepare a bootable Lion install &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; key (used Lion downloaded from Mac App Store and stored in&amp;nbsp;/Applications)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reboot, press F12 to select alternative boot device, choose &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;#8230;install&amp;nbsp;Lion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;restart Lion with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; key still inserted, run Multibeast with customized &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSDT&lt;/span&gt; (check &lt;code&gt;UserDSDT Install&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multibeast setting: Drivers &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Bootloaders/Kext &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Enablers/Audio/Realtek ALC8xx/&lt;strong&gt;ALC8xxHD&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;AppleHD Rollback&lt;/strong&gt; checked, Non-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSDT&lt;/span&gt; HDAEnabler/&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALC889&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;checked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multibeast setting: Disk/&lt;strong&gt;3rdParty &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SATA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TRIM&lt;/span&gt; Enabler&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;checked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multibeast setting: System Definitions/&lt;strong&gt;Mac mini&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;checked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the little shit (usb wifi) work that&amp;#8217;s what I did (see also &lt;a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;amp;t=37337"&gt;http://www.tonymacx86.com/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;amp;t=37337&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;install official&amp;nbsp;driver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;patch kext: edit the Info.plist file in &lt;code&gt;RT2870USBWirelessDriver.kext&lt;/code&gt; (located in System/Library/Extensions) and change values of vendor and device &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; in Info.plist to match those of actual &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; device listed in System Profiler (note: system profiler shows values in hex format, Info.plist has to be&amp;nbsp;decimal)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;download modded ralink software Ralink-Airport.zip from &lt;a href="http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=168984&amp;amp;view=findpost&amp;amp;p=1168621"&gt;http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=168984&amp;amp;view=findpost&amp;amp;p=1168621&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unzip Ralink-Airport.zip and move the folder into your Applications&amp;nbsp;folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter System Preferences &amp;gt; Users &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Groups &amp;gt; Login&amp;nbsp;Items&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove AwakeRalinkUI/ from the list by selecting it and clicking on the &amp;#8220;-&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;icon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add RalinkAirport and Airport Connection to the list (RalinkAirport above the&amp;nbsp;other)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the &amp;#8216;Hide&amp;#8217; option for both these&amp;nbsp;apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;load Airport&amp;nbsp;Connection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/179731/hackintosh%20multibeast%201.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original settings I checked, but I forgot one little thing, which caused no sound to be&amp;nbsp;heard&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/179731/hackintosh%20multibeast%202.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8230;and this is what I forgot. Just remember to check the appropriate Non-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSDT&lt;/span&gt; HDAEnabler and you&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;set.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/179731/hackintosh%20usb%20wifi.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That&amp;#8217;s the kind of crap you gotta do to enable the wifi usb&amp;nbsp;stick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;results and&amp;nbsp;benchmarks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man, now I have a mac that really flies! Only it&amp;#8217;s not a mac but a&amp;nbsp;hack!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are some quick geekbench (v2.3.1 32bit) and xbench results; I have compared the hack-mini to my other two computers (the Air is a 1.4Ghz Core 2 Duo 11&amp;#8221; and 4Gb ram, the macmini is a 2.6Ghz Core 2 Duo and 4Gb ram) and to my the mighty macbook pro of my friend Daniele who happens to live in California so of course he screams faster than us (it&amp;#8217;s a Core i7 running at 2Ghz with 12Gb&amp;nbsp;ram).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;computer     | geekbench      | xbench &lt;br&gt;
hack-mini    | 8953           | 336&lt;br&gt;
mb air       | 2087           | 117&lt;br&gt;
macmini      | 3744           | 215&lt;br&gt;
mb pro i7    | 9608           |&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8212;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;references&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;tonymacx86&lt;/em&gt; is the place to go. First wet your appetites with the &lt;em&gt;lifehacker&lt;/em&gt; guide though. I also suggest if you have time to read the &lt;em&gt;howtogeek&lt;/em&gt; guide because it does add some extra bits of information which could be useful if you are in trouble and need to navigate into tonymacx86&amp;#8217;s forums; as usual these are shady places, full of nerds that speak their own language and it&amp;#8217;s easy to stumble onto obscure acronyms such as S/L/E&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;extra: Filippo&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;build&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My pal Filippo is also following the idea and building another hackintosh, slightly less powerful than mine (he&amp;#8217;s got a Nikon D100 with 6Mp files after all). The main difference from my setup (apart from the dual-core i3 cpu) is the use of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TP&lt;/span&gt;-Link &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TL&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WN951N&lt;/span&gt; 300Mbps Wireless &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCI&lt;/span&gt; Adapter based on an Atheros chip (which should make it easy to have it up and running with no sweating over drivers&amp;nbsp;etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;stele.it&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;extra: the macmini upgraded to the living&amp;nbsp;room&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another good thing that came out of this is that I now have an incredible media player in my living room. I&amp;#8217;ve stripped down the macmini and installed the free and oustanding &lt;a href="http://xbmc.org/"&gt;xbmc media player&lt;/a&gt; (which I knew from the time when I had a hacked xbox doing the job; xbmc was born on the xbox and then migrated to other&amp;nbsp;shores).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This xbmc is fantastic; does a perfect job of scanning your library and acquiring plot synopsis and cover arts for your movies, and then it&amp;#8217;s fully expandable with small applications to do things like downloading subtitles on the fly and control torrent&amp;nbsp;downloading.&lt;/p&gt;

You might have a different idea about your everyday tasks and what you really need a computer for. After all, that&amp;#8217;s why iPads are so common nowadays, because Joe Average just need to read stuff on the internet, check his email, occasionally edit a spreadsheet (oh, and watch pirated movies).&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should write something more about Snapseed, how this approach to photo editing is perfect for an iPhone.  I was one of those nerds who like to endlessly play with Curves, so my philosophy has always been that you need to work hard to improve a shot, and the idea of applying an automatic adjuster-thingy was never&amp;nbsp;considered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet here I am, with some black and white / fake Tri-X shots of&amp;nbsp;Giulia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must say I really wanted to like this app (&lt;em&gt;nice developers from Germany:
check!, free as in free beer: check! cross-platform compatibility: check!&lt;/em&gt;)
but the fact that such a simple task is being handled like it&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stuck with Lockbox Lite for a long time on my iPhone. Then I got fed up
about not being able to have the same data available also on my two Macs (not
to mention the stupid ads). So I started looking for something that had these&amp;nbsp;features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stuck with Lockbox Lite for a long time on my iPhone. Then I got fed up
about not being able to have the same data available also on my two Macs (not
to mention the stupid ads). So I started looking for something that had these&amp;nbsp;features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quick 4-digits general password to access all the&amp;nbsp;rest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sync between iPhone and&amp;nbsp;mac&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the first point, I know that it&amp;#8217;s a weak point and raises the question
&amp;#8220;why using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AES&lt;/span&gt; 256-bit encryption if you rely on a 4-digit number to secure
all your confidential data&amp;#8221;. Well, I&amp;#8217;m not overly paranoid about this stuff &amp;#8212;
and then the alternative is to keep my passwords in a text file somewhere on
my&amp;nbsp;computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that there is lots of apps and systems to do this, and most of them
come with a price. Hefty price for some, more reasonable for&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overkill:&amp;nbsp;1password&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Option number one was &lt;a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/onepassword"&gt;1password&lt;/a&gt;.
Wonderful program, very effective, easy to use, lots of options&amp;nbsp;but:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;expensive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&amp;#8217;s supposed to ease your life by making 1-click logins to ebanking sites and stuff like this but it doesn&amp;#8217;t work so well with Chrome (I can&amp;#8217;t even do the 1-click thing with Gmail&amp;nbsp;!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I got fed up pretty quickly (it was an all-in-a-night research), especially
considering that I had to shell out how much ? &amp;#8212; about $35 for the Mac app
and another $5-6 for the iPhone app. And on top of that, i don&amp;#8217;t even have
that many passwords or bank accounts. So it was like using napalm to fry a&amp;nbsp;fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The&amp;nbsp;alternatives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I looked at other options. Well it&amp;#8217;s actually hard to find &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt;
alternative to 1password on the net. Everybody seems to have bought that
friggin&amp;#8217; app, so if somebody asks: &amp;#8220;Hi, can you recommend a cheap alternative
to 1password&amp;#8221;, everybody replies like this: &amp;#8220;Hey no you &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MUST&lt;/span&gt; get 1password&amp;#8221;.
Thanks (you moron), but I did just say that I was looking at an &lt;em&gt;alternative&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after another couple of hours of googling around, I&amp;#8217;ve found that the
options out there are the&amp;nbsp;following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;free but just for 30&amp;nbsp;days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;free but just if you use the computer&amp;nbsp;app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;free but just if you use the mobile&amp;nbsp;app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;free but butt-ugly and no sync (&lt;a href="http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Password Safe&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;free but too complicated and no apps (&lt;a href="http://keepass.info/"&gt;KeePass&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The italian route:&amp;nbsp;iAccounts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I went down the italian route; I mean I chose this app programmed by fellow
italians; smooth, simple, with a neat little Mac application which is free and
gives you the ability to do basic records editing, backup/restore and
import/export of data in csv&amp;nbsp;format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s called &lt;a href="http://www.venticentostudio.it/site/iAccounts.htm"&gt;iAccounts&lt;/a&gt; and
I thoroughly recommend it. Only 4 euros, and it works like a charm. The free
Mac companion is &lt;a href="http://www.venticentostudio.it/site/iBackup.htm"&gt;iBackup&lt;/a&gt;,
it gets the job done and the only thing I don&amp;#8217;t like about it is the&amp;nbsp;name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some nerdy stuff to make it work between&amp;nbsp;Macs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the reason why I started writing about this is that I had to geek around a
little bit, first to import the data, then to try and setup a sort of sync
between computers (I have a macmini and a macbook air, and I wanna be able to
access the same database from both computers). And I thought this could be of
interest to somebody out&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what I did is simply to create a symbolic link on both computers that
redirect iBackup to use the same database; such database is of course stored
on my Dropbox (I know you were all expecting it; I mean, who does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use
Dropbox these days&amp;nbsp;?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For you guys who are command line-impaired, here&amp;#8217;s how to do&amp;nbsp;it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ ln -s ~/Dropbox/iBackup2.data ~/Library/Application Support/iBackup/iBackup2.data&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Oh and the the import of csv data ? It&amp;#8217;s great, I played around a little bit
with awk and Textmate to adjust the file exported from Lockbox, and at the end
I created two .csv files, one for web passwords and various logins and the
other for my credit/debit&amp;nbsp;cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a sample of the main&amp;nbsp;.csv:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Group Name,Record Name,Username,Password,Note
Websites,photo.net,dummy@gmail.com,1234,better when there was Greenspun
Computers,macbookair,genius,qwerty,login to my macbook air 11&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And this is the second file to import credit cards&amp;nbsp;details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Group Name,Record Name,Issuer,Number,Holder,Valid From,Valid To,PIN,Note
Cards,Pig VISA,Pig Bank,4444 3333 2222 1111,NAME,01/10,01/13,0000,CCV=999
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

What is available now is certainly enticing and must be a joy for light computing / intense internet reading. I do have limited budget, however, and think that probably the iPhone 4 is a better way to spend my money. But I look at the iPad and keep thinking that it could be a photographer&amp;#8217;s ideal machine; if only it had a straight usb port to connect a camera (if I travel light, I certainly do care about bringing yet another little piece of&amp;nbsp;plastic).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other option could be that Apple is waiting for Canon and Nikon to put wi-fi or bluetooth connection to send the files wirelessly to the iPad. Well that certainly could help (I hate cables), but I don&amp;#8217;t think Apple thinks in terms of being helped by&amp;nbsp;others.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that pretty much sums it up for the hardware. Which means that I don&amp;#8217;t expect Apple to put a camera&lt;sup id="fnref:note1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:note1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on the iPad (too bulky, I will never use it for snapshots &amp;#8212; there&amp;#8217;s the iPhone for that); I am not waiting for a faster processor; the form factor and size looks perfect; a higher-resolution screen like the iPhone 4&amp;#8217;s retina display could be nice&amp;nbsp;though.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the software now: this is the area where I am expecting great things from Adobe. A light-Lightroom, that&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;m waiting for. Or a quicker Aperture from&amp;nbsp;Apple.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking about the idea of editing photos directly on the iPad. You might argue that editing 12 Mpixel raw photos is not practical on a underpowered machine like the iPad. But here&amp;#8217;s the point: I don&amp;#8217;t want to edit the raws. I want to edit the associated jpegs&lt;sup id="fnref:note2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:note2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. And then link all the editing parameters (remember that Lightroom is a non-destructive editing software) to the desktop version where you would actually store all the large&amp;nbsp;raws.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: a Lightroom-mobile with a nice user interface that allows me to catalog and edit photos; its internal database is made of the associated jpegs. Some tweaks to have only a certain amount of photos stored on the iPad itself, but still the entire database structure would be available on the iPad and a few taps would mark certain sets to be sync&amp;#8217;d and their jpegs downloaded on the iPad when it&amp;#8217;s connected to the main&amp;nbsp;machine.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower resolution jpegs would be good enough for displaying directly on the iPad, even when it&amp;#8217;s connected to an external projector. They are light enough that working on them would be a breeze even on the iPad. And the editing parameters would be transferred and applied to the large raws on your desktop&amp;nbsp;computer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/4854784575/"&gt;&lt;img alt="ipad-per-fotografi" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4102/4854784575_f53b6b23e7.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this could really work. Is there anybody listening at Adobe&amp;nbsp;?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 2012&lt;/strong&gt;: After a while I did get hold of an iPad, and I had great plans to use it for my photos. I was using Lightroom back in June 2011 and I found this app which seemed like a dream come true: &lt;a href="http://blog.photosmithapp.com/index.php/photosmith-the-grand-tour/"&gt;Photosmith&lt;/a&gt;. I got in touch with one of the developers, Chris Morse, and he was nice enough to send me an interesting reply. I hope he doesn&amp;#8217;t mind if I quote&amp;nbsp;him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&amp;#8230;] As for your expectations, let me share this little quote I read once, &amp;#8220;Ahh, the optimism of inexperience. Soon to be crushed by the dismal intrusion of&amp;nbsp;reality.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use that quote (in humor) only because I think I have to lower/crush your expectations&amp;#8230; We don&amp;#8217;t do any kind of image editing [yet].  At this point in time we&amp;#8217;re strictly the things that you can find in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LR&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Library module. (minus the quick develop&amp;nbsp;stuff).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for the rest of the things you imagine, I think we&amp;#8217;re on&amp;nbsp;target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened next is that I left Lightroom and moved to Aperture, the iPad became a gift to Giulia and so I ended up with no iPad, no Lightroom, and no way to test&amp;nbsp;Photosmith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, considering the interest that Apple has always shown for photography, I really hope that an Aperture companion app find his way to the Appstore someday. That&amp;#8217;s gonna be a nice excuse for me to get an iPad&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/p&gt;

Pero&amp;#8217; ti hanno detto che aprire il macmini non e&amp;#8217; cosa proprio facilissima, insomma non serve semplicemente smollare 4 viti come con quei vecchi pc con cui&amp;nbsp;giocavi.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allora telefoni al negozio a Milano che ti pare il migliore, anche perche&amp;#8217; i tipi che ci lavorano dentro sono simpatici e sembrano piu&amp;#8217; competenti di quelli che trovi da Mondadori Informatica. Il negozio e&amp;#8217; mac@work,&amp;nbsp;diciamolo.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiami, chiedi il costo totale (della ram piu&amp;#8217; &amp;#8220;manodopera&amp;#8221;): ti sparano centonovanta&amp;nbsp;euro.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dopo il mezzo infarto, provi la via economica, che all&amp;#8217;inizio avevi deciso di scartare per vari motivi (timore di spaccare il mac, pigrizia, il ricordo di tutte le altre volte che volendo fare da solo hai distrutto/rovinato/scartavetrato i tuoi&amp;nbsp;giocattoli).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La via economica e&amp;#8217; questa: vai da un punto vendita di essedi.it, ti compri la ram da 1Gb (una &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DIMM&lt;/span&gt; da 184 pin &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC3200&lt;/span&gt;) a 99 euro, poi vai da bricorama a prendere una spatolina da muratore (costo: 80 centesimi di&amp;nbsp;euro),  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Torni a casa, ti guardi il video che hai trovato da qualche parte sulla rete, fai la punta alla spatolina con della carta vetrata e con  un po&amp;#8217; di accortezza apri il mini, levi la ram da 512Mb e ci metti quella da&amp;nbsp;1Gb.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rimonti il tutto, hai perso circa mezz&amp;#8217;ora ma risparmiato cento&amp;nbsp;euro.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 2012: Sembra davvero un&amp;#8217;eternita&amp;#8217; da quando ho scritto questa nota; riguardando i miei vecchi post &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-01-23-moving-to-calepin.html"&gt;durante la migrazione a Calepin&lt;/a&gt; ho letto il mio update del 2008 e non ho resistito alla tentazione di aggiungere che per l&amp;#8217;ennesima volta ho smesso con gli esperimenti&amp;#8230; e sono su Google Chrome fisso, grazie alla possibilita&amp;#8217; di tenere tutto sincronizzato con l&amp;#8217;ufficio.

&lt;p&gt;I should include a technical note here together with a bit of history, but since I&amp;#8217;m not the most qualified for this sort of thing I&amp;#8217;ll keep it short and simple: mp3 is a format that stores music in compressed format, therefore with some quality degradation (high compression=high degradation=low quality music=small file); wav/aiff is the format that is used for audio CDs, highest quality, uncompressed, large files (size ratio is 10:1 for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt;-quality files versus mp3 files). So a bunch of people came up with some new formats for digital music, such as ape and flac. These are lossless compression formats &amp;#8212; which means that they have exactly the same quality of the input &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; music, but they&amp;#8217;re half the size. So if you don&amp;#8217;t want to trade on quality, go for&amp;nbsp;ape/flac.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you just want to play this music and convert it in mp3, add it to iTunes, etc ? The answer is &lt;strong&gt;xACT&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a little Mac &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; X wrapper for a set of command-line tools available also for Linux and&amp;nbsp;Windows..  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here we&amp;nbsp;go:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;make sure you have both the music.ape and the music.ape.cue file (the .cue file contains the split points and the name of the&amp;nbsp;tracks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;launch xACT, go to the &amp;#8220;shntool&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;tab&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;select the &amp;#8220;split&amp;#8221; option; select the output format (usually I&amp;#8217;d use aiff, then leave the conversion to mp3/aac format to&amp;nbsp;iTunes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;drag the music.ape file in the drop area on the&amp;nbsp;left&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;click the &amp;#8220;Call Shntool&amp;#8221; button; the app will now ask for the location of the file with split point data; that&amp;#8217;s you music.ape.cue file ! Just select the .cue file, choose an output folder and the splitting/conversion process will&amp;nbsp;begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few notes to finish&amp;nbsp;up:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the cue file should begin with the &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FILE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; line; if it doesn&amp;#8217;t then delete the first lines (they could have other information such as performer and title of the&amp;nbsp;album).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there&amp;#8217;s very little information about what xACT is doing; if you&amp;#8217;re worried that it might be stuck just have a look at the output folder, where you should see the output aiff files being created. Or just fire up the Activity Monitor, and look at processes called &amp;#8220;sox&amp;#8221;, or &amp;#8220;mac&amp;#8221; (usually with a fairly high degree of cpu&amp;nbsp;usage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xACT has lots of other options which can be helpful (you can, for example, create an .ape file with its .cue info sheet), but unfortunately has no automatic file renaming tool based on the cue files. So you&amp;#8217;re kinda stuck with a set of music files called &amp;#8220;split-track001.aiff&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;split-track002.aiff&amp;#8221;,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be simple enough to put together a perl or ruby script which has as input the cue file and does the job for&amp;nbsp;you. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="computer"></category></entry><entry><title>italian gtd</title><link href="http://aadm.github.io/2005-08-24-italian-gtd.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2005-08-24T08:26:00+02:00</published><updated>2005-08-24T08:26:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Alessandro Amato del Monte</name></author><id>tag:aadm.github.io,2005-08-24:/2005-08-24-italian-gtd.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some time ago I stumbled upon this thing, the Getting Things Done thing, aka &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTD&lt;/span&gt;.

How do you wanna call it ? A geekish obsession ? A lifestyle idea for nerds&amp;nbsp;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the &lt;a href="http://merlin.blogs.com/43folders/2004/09/introducing_the.html"&gt;Hipster &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDA&lt;/span&gt; post was pretty cool&lt;/a&gt; (and fun to read). I have experienced myself the pleasure of having a toy like a palm (used to have the transparent Palm IIIe, upgraded with a IIIx motherboard, then switched to a Sony Clie), only to realize it was a useless and timewasting piece of equipment, and switched back to post-it notes and my trusty old mobile (6310i) to keep the phone numbers and&amp;nbsp;passwords.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I read all these things on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTD&lt;/span&gt; (I&amp;#8217;ll give you only a link where to look at: &lt;a href="http://www.43folders.com/"&gt;43folders&lt;/a&gt;, enough said !), and even though I&amp;#8217;ll never plan my life according to a book, I still like some of the ideas that float around the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTD&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just for the purpose of sharing, here&amp;#8217;s a list of my tools to do the lowlevel italian implementation of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTD&lt;/span&gt;, let&amp;#8217;s call it iGTnD (italian&amp;#8217;s getting things nearly&amp;nbsp;done).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;gmail&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invaluable to keep my personal ife separated from my work. I always have my browser opened on gmail even when I&amp;#8217;m in the office, so I can distinguish between work and pleasureand when I&amp;#8217;m back home I wait 8pm (my broadband flat rate goes from 8pm to 8am), launch BitTorrent, then Safari, point to gmail, zap. I use labels a lot: have some filters to automatically label ebay messages and emails from my best buddies, others that archive the rss feeds coming from novatorrent so I&amp;#8217;m updated on the new torrents available; an &amp;#8220;info&amp;#8221; label is for messages with information on my online accounts (forums, photo.net passwords etc.), &amp;#8220;foto&amp;#8221; is for emails containing photographs, &amp;#8220;banking&amp;#8221; is for my e-banking needs, &amp;#8220;blog&amp;#8221; to hold the posts that Blogger automatically sends me whenever I update this site. I then use the Drafts to keep a series of messages with to do things, blog drafts, web links to follow, and so on. To create these posts you only need to compose a new mail, leave the to-field empty, write a descriptive subject (e.g., &amp;#8220;blog: my own gtd implementation&amp;#8221;, or &amp;#8220;movies to check&amp;#8221; and then fill in the&amp;nbsp;body).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;gigantic&amp;nbsp;todo.txt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following &lt;a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/7567"&gt;something read on an O&amp;#8217;Reilly weblog&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to get rid of my HTMLs, my &lt;a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/"&gt;tiddlywiki&lt;/a&gt;, my sticky notes, my info stored as Excel or Word documents, and get back to text files. At the same time I also deleted all the fancy power-user text editors that I was trying (Textforge, BBEdit and so on), and rely on the very basic Text Editor that is part of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; X (same thing as Notepad, for you Windows folks out there). So now I have one todo.txt to keep everything, and I&amp;#8217;m thinking to keep information already consolidated in separate files (e.g., unix.txt for everything related to the command line, such as scripts, tricks and hints). Other useful discussions about the big-ass text file are &lt;a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/08/life_inside_one.html"&gt;here on 43folders.com&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20040922131625587&amp;amp;query=remind+cal"&gt;macosxhints.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;mini hipster pda (and assorted pieces of&amp;nbsp;paper)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve absorbed the idea of collecting together pieces of paper with a paper clip and then tear the notes off when I&amp;#8217;ve completed the tasks, that&amp;#8217;s right. Since it&amp;#8217;s difficult to get hold of the 3x5 sheets as originally suggested in 43folders, I use either a stack of my old business cards, or something similar which I usually &amp;#8220;borrow&amp;#8221; from my office. The good thing is to lay these papers on my table back home and &amp;#8220;fill in the&amp;nbsp;blanks&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;post-it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, difficult to get rid of these yellow things ! The grocery list is for example something that invariably comes up in my mind while at work, so I write down on a post-it which I then put into my wallet for later&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;to&amp;nbsp;conclude&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is pretty simple and straightforward stuff, but to actually read how many people are bothered by these side-issues and the way they deal with them was a little revelation and a big help to sort out my problematic approach to &amp;#8220;do&amp;nbsp;things&amp;#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="computer"></category><category term="misc"></category><category term="tech"></category></entry></feed>
